This tool was created as part of my dissertation for my Master's in Computer Science for Games. It allows you to test several cutting edge upscaling techniques within the context of the same rendering engine and on the exact same scenes!

This repo was forked from Microsoft's DX12 Samples repository, as I did not have enough time to construct an entire renderng engine from scratch. Please find their README at their repo below
